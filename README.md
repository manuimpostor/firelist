# Firelist = Burner Lists + Pomodoro Timer

## How to use

- Commit to short term (1-3 day) focus topic and one secondary topic
- Add rest of ToDos to Dumpster Fire
- Start timer to work on topics in maintainable speed
- Check in regulary on how fcking unfocused you are working on dumpster fire distratctions
- Get better

## Why it is magic

- The space on page represents importance. Main topic half of the space, dumpster fire 1/4
- If after 10h you are still mainly on the right side of the page you have either a
+ focus problem (you/I work on the unimportant)
+ goal setting problem (you/I have unrealisitc expectations of what is important)

## Open Questions / Things missing / Things need fixing

- encrypt the cookie stuff
- Handle empty states gracefully
- Timer counts down nicely in unfocused tab
- Deployment
- Is the 25/5 min timer the right interval? Longer sessions might be good but that forced 5min break makes it very sustainable (get eyes of screen and move around).
